Ball Control
===========

Software used to control a ping-pong ball suspended from the ceiling by three threads attached to dc motors using a Kinect to track its position.

The goals of this project are:
* Develop some basic mechanical and electrical engineering skills in assembling the system.
* Experiment with computer vision techniques for tracking the ball with the Kinect.
* Experiment with computer learning techniques needed to make sense of the ball position data.
* Derive a predictive model of a motors response to a given power input for a given ball position.
* Learn how to move the ball smoothly through space along a predictable curve.
